State Driven Development (SDD) is very useful (and after this week, I feel that i have a better understanding of that) for the fact that instead of building the application by the design (don't discard design by any means) you build an app by where and what the state is doing. In doing so, you are able to quickly and with less brain power build the app without swapping and switching where state goes. You also don't have to do as much testing, because you KNOW what your stae(data) will be doing, and don't have to be as concerned besides the fact of checking main functions and verify the app works.

adding sentence I liked 'if your statement in building has "and" in it, it is a good indicator of seperate components/functions.
